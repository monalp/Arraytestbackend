- ** First enable SSL in Visual Studio Development Server before you run web application **

     To enable SSL in the Visual Studio development server, you need to follow the below steps
     In the Solution Explorer click on the TestProj1 Web API project and press F4 key on the keyboard which will open the Project Properties window. From the Project Properties window, we need to set the SSL Enabled property to true. As soon as you do this Visual Studio sets the SSL URL

     Once you set the SSL Enabled property to True, now you have two URLs one is SSL URL and the other one is the only URL. The SSL URL is https://localhost:44376/ and the URL is http://localhost:50333//


     Build the solution and then navigate to https://localhost:44376/ URL in the browser and you will see the following browser security page. Make sure you click on the “Advanced” link to see the “Proceed to localhost” link. Once accept it will take you to the application webpage.
